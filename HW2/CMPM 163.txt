CMPM 163 -HW 2Evita LoboPart A: Magic Mushroomshttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1H-V2wrsb6zyX8yD-umFEtZg492OfFZyR?usp=sharingI used a Bloom filter on the camera screen space that brightens and blurs objects. I applied a Phong/Rim Shader to the two mushrooms on the end. The mushroom in the middle has a normal phong shader applied. The two cubes use an outline shader that shows the emissive values on the mushroom once it passes and the sphere has a standard shader. Both the sphere and cube demonstrate that the mushrooms have an x-ray effect on them. You may move around the scene using WASD keys.Part B: Lost at Sunsethttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1yVp3FoshHpbDwXMtSAXH4ifkmERRyvzC?usp=sharingI used the mesh to create a scene that uses materials to demonstrate an island surrounded by the ocean. The cracked texture, desert sand and green seascape represent that of an islands terrain. The water shader I used reflects the light off of the skybox and the rate and strength of the current are dependent on the mouse’s X and Y position on the screen. You may use WASD to move around the scene.Links to StandAlone files: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1HaR2k1lCS8piTYLSJZ6k_W4xeJDAJ_V6
