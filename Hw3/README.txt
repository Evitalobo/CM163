HW 3CM 163Evita Lobo I created a colorful cloud using Perlin noise and a particle effect for lightning.  When the thunder booms and lightning strikes in the sound, you can see that there are additional lightning/ electrical currents that are emitted from the clouds. You can use WASD to move the cloud around the scene and the Mouse’s X position on the screen dictates the displacememnt amount for the vertices of the cloud. So the closer it is to the left screen, the less it is being displaced.To demo the project, click the link below:https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ozUyMp9CWmrzdAMVertxu0Fz1-u5iLvb/view?usp=sharing
